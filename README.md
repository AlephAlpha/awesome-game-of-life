### Catalyst
* [Bellman](https://sourceforge.net/projects/bellman/) - A
program for searching for catalytic interactions in Conway's Game of Life and potentially other similar cellular automata.
* [Catalyst](http://www.gabrielnivasch.org/fun/life/) - A program that finds ways of modifying the evolution of an input pattern by placing catalysts that react with it, by a backtracking search.
